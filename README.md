# Final_Project
In this project DEM data and field measurements will be compared for gully features. The data is acquired in
Navarra, Spain, in a small catchment (La Tejeria). The point data was obtained by using an RTK on both edges of
a gully and in between every 5 cm the gully depth was measured by hand. This project uses Python to import the data
in ArcGIS for combining DEM data for the points measured in the field and afterwards the analysis is done in R.
